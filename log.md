# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 14 May 2024
##### And so it begins.
I'm currently working through the FreeCodeCamps responsive web design course. I'm currently on the CSS portion, and even with prior knowledge i'm picking up new things that seem to have changed or wasn't taught when i did web design in the 2000's. I'm not sure what exactly i'm going to do this 100 day challenge on, and it feels like i need to be prepared before starting, but for now - i'm just planting my feet and beginning. I need to learn how to use GitHub too.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
